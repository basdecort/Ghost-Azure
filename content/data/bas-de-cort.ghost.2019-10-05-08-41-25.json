In a\nfollowing session James Montemagno [https://twitter.com/JamesMontemagno]  and \nMiguel De Icaza [https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza]  got into more detail and\neven showed more epic new features. As always to two put on a great show while\npresenting!\n\n> Together with my colleague Marco [http://twitter.com/marcofolio], I’ll cover\nannouncements made at the Microsoft Build conference in a series of blogposts.\nYou can also read these posts on his blog [http://marcofolio.net/].\nXamarin Live Player\nWhen Xamarin Live Player (XLP) [https://www.xamarin.com/live]  was announced\nduring the Build keynote, most of the audience was pleasantly surprised. Until\nnow developing on Windows for iOS was a serious hassle because it required a Mac\nto compile the app. This setup works well when you have an expensive Mac and a\nfast and reliable network, but in a lot of scenarios these builds take up a lot\nof time.\n\nWith XLP you don’t need a Mac build host anymore! You just install the Xamarin\nLive Player app from the App Store [https://aka.ms/live-player-ios]  or Play\nStore [https://aka.ms/live-player-ios], pair your device in Visual Studio and\nboom! You’re ready to debug on the device. Just select your device (annotated\nwith “Player”) en hit run:\n\nBesides the build improvements XLP has more to offer! You can also modify your\nXamarin.Forms or Xamarin.Classic app while debugging so you can easily test\nchanges to your app without stopping and restarting the debug process.\nThis will really speed up the development! To achieve this you first have to\nopen the view you want to debug live. For now a Xamarin.Forms Xaml and iOS\nstoryboards are supported, when XLP becomes GA all types of views should be\nsupported. After opening your view file, you can run the with Visual Studio by\nclicking “Run -> Live Run Current View” on Mac or “Tools -> Xamarin Live Player\n-> Live Run Current View” on Windows.\n\nXLP is still in preview and after some testing we are still experiencing a few\ndifficulties. If you want to give XLP a try, you’re probably best of using the\nexamples provided by James Montemagno\n[https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/build2017-future-of-mobile/].\n\nFastlane\nIf you’ve ever developed an app for iOS you probably felt the pain of having to\nprovision your app in the Apple Developer Portal. Although there is a good (and\nvery long) read\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/device_provisioning/] \n on how to accomplish this, you don’t want to waste any time on this. This is\nwhere Fastlane [https://fastlane.tools/]  comes to the rescue. With Fastlane\n[https://fastlane.tools/]  tools installed you are able to provision your app\nwith a few clicks in Visual Studio! Fastlane also comes in handy when releasing\nyour app to the Stores. It handles all tedious tasks, like generating\nscreenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your application.\n\nXaml standard 1.0\nDuring the Build Conference Microsoft also introduced a new standard for XAML,\ncalled XAML Standard 1.0 [https://github.com/Microsoft/xaml-standard]. The\nstandard will describe a specification for cross-platform user interfaces for\nboth UWP and Xamarin.Forms. As for now, XAML Standard is in a very early stage\nand Microsoft encourages developers to contribute to their specification. 1.0\nshould become available later this year.\n\nBindings simplified\nXamarin was already supporting usage of native libraries with Android binding\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/binding-a-java-library/]\nand iOS binding\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c/] \nprojects.

In the beginning, \nMonoDevelop [http://www.monodevelop.com/]  was the IDE\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment]  to develop\nC# on a Mac, which later converted to Xamarin Studio\n[http://www.xamarin.com/studio/]  (XS). But since the Build-conference\n[https://build.microsoft.com/]  this week, VS4Mac has gone GA which made it the\nprime IDE for C# developers on MacOS. Because of this, XS is discontinued\n[https://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno/status/862787591241846784]  and VS4Mac is\nthe way to go. Awesome!\n\nVS4Mac isn’t just a rebrand of XS, is has tons of new features added. When it\nwas Xamarin Studio, you would be able to build apps, games & services for mobile\nusing the technology from Xamarin [https://www.xamarin.com/]. Now that it has\nturned into Visual Studio, you can even make Web and Cloud applications that you\ncan deploy on Microsoft Azure [https://azure.microsoft.com/]. But that’s not\nall: VS4Mac also has C# 7.0 support\n[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/03/09/new-features-in-c-7-0/]!\nYou’ll now be able to create stuff like Local functions  and more of the great\nstuff C# 7.0 brings us (all running on Mono 5.0\n[http://www.mono-project.com/download/]).\n\nWhen creating a Native Mobile App in VS4Mac, you’ll now have the option to add a\nMobile Backend, which adds a ASP.NET [http://asp.net/]  Core Web API project  to\nthe solution as well.

If you are transferring small packages this might be interesting.\n   The classic way of bluetooth communication is also less consuming than\n   network connectivity.\n\nInstead of writing the bluetooth code for every platform, you can choose to use\na plugin that provides an abstraction layer so it’s possible to access BLE from\nshared code. At the time of writing, I find Bluetooth LE Plugin for Xamarin\n[https://github.com/xabre/xamarin-bluetooth-le]  the best pick for the job. The\nplug-in is easy to implement and is continuously getting updates. If you want to\nuse classic bluetooth you might want to look into some other plugins. in this\npost I will focus on Bluetooth LE Plugin for Xamarin\n[https://www.nuget.org/packages/Plugin.BLE/].\n\nWhen working with BLE, there are 3 (most important) different bluetooth\nabstraction layers:\n\n * Services: A service [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services] \n   contains one or more characteristics. For example, you could have a service\n   called “Heart Rate service”\n   [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml&u=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml] \n    that includes characteristics such as “heart rate measurement.” Each service\n   has it’s unique pre-defined 16-bit or 128-bit UUID\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier].\n * Characteristics: A characteristic\n   [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/characteristics]  is some kind\n   of endpoint for a specific part of the service. Just like a service, the\n   characteristic also has a UUID\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier].\n   Characteristics support a range of different interactions: read, write,\n   notify, indicate, signedWrite, writableAuxilliaries, broadcast.\n * Descriptors: Descriptors\n   [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/descriptors]  are defined\n   attributes that describe a characteristic value. For example, a descriptor\n   might specify a human-readable description, an acceptable range for a\n   characteristic’s value, or a unit of measure that is specific to a\n   characteristic’s value.\n\nNow, let’s dive into some code samples! To give you a taste of what the plugin\nhas in store for you, some snippets:\n\nScan for BLE devices (advertisements)\nThe Adapter class makes it possible to detect devices in the surrounding area.\nYou can simply get an instance of the adapter and start scanning with the\nfollowing code:\n\nvar adapter = CrossBluetoothLE.Current.Adapter;\nadapter.DeviceDiscovered += (s,a) =+ deviceList.Add(a.Device);\nawait adapter.StartScanningForDevicesAsync();\n\nConnect to device\nWhen you’ve found the device you want to connect to, you are able to initiate a\nconnection with the device. After connecting successfully to a device you are\nable to get the available characteristics and start sending requests or start\nretrieving notifications from the device. When the bluetooth device doesn’t\nreceive any requests for a specific period (may differ per device), it will\ndisconnect to save battery power. After getting a device instance (with the\nprevious sample), it’s fairly easy to setup a connection:\n\ntry\n{\n    await _adapter.ConnectToDeviceAsync(device);\n}\ncatch(DeviceConnectionException e)\n{\n// ... could not connect to device\n}\n\nNote: a device scan is only necessary when connecting to the device for the\nfirst time. It’s also possible to initiate a connection based on the UUID of the\ndevice.\n\nGet services, characteristics, descriptors\nAs described above, a service is the first abstraction layer. When an instance\nof a service is resolved, the characteristics of this specific service can be\nrequested. The same goes for a characteristic and his descriptors. On a\ncharacteristic you can request the descriptors.\n\nThe different abstraction layers can be requested in a similar way, GetAll or\nGetById:\n\n// Get All services and getting a specific service\nvar services = await connectedDevice.GetServicesAsync();\nvar service = await connectedDevice.GetServiceAsync(Guid.Parse(\"ffe0ecd2-3d16-4f8d-90de-e89e7fc396a5\"));\n \n// Get All characteristics and getting a specific characteristic\nvar characteristics = await service.GetCharacteristicsAsync();\nvar characteristic = await service.GetCharacteristicAsync(Guid.Parse(\"37f97614-f7f7-4ae5-9db8-0023fb4215ca\"));\n \n// Get All descriptors and getting a specific descriptor\nvar descriptors = await characteristic.GetDescriptorsAsync();\nvar descriptor = await characteristic.GetDescriptorAsync(Guid.Parse(\"6f361a84-eeac-404c-ae48-e65b9cba6af8\"));\n\nSend write command\nAfter retrieving an instance of the characteristic you’re able to interact with\nit. Writing bytes for example:\n\nawait characteristic.WriteAsync(bytes);\n\nSend read command\nYou can also request information from a characteristic:\n\nvar bytes = await characteristic.ReadAsync();\n\nPretty easy, right? To get you started, you can find an example project\n[https://github.com/xabre/xamarin-bluetooth-le/tree/master/Source]  on the \nBluetooth LE Plugin GitHub [https://github.com/xabre/xamarin-bluetooth-le] \npage. Although this seems pretty simple,  I’ve experienced some difficulties in\nmaking it rock solid. Some tips to improve your code:\n\n * Run bluetooth code on main thread.\n * Don’t scan for devices and send commands simultaneously, also don’t send\n   multiple commands simultaneously. A characteristic can only execute one\n   request at a time.\n * Adjust ScanMode to suit your use case.\n * Don’t store instances of characteristics or services.\n\nRelated links:\n\n * Bluetooth LE plugin for Xamarin: \n   https://github.com/xabre/xamarin-bluetooth-le\n * Android developer docs, BLE: \n   https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html\n * Android developer docs, bluetooth: \n   https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html","feature_image":"/content/images/2019/04/ble-header-2.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Talkin Bluetooth (Low Energy) with Xamarin","meta_description":"With the rising popularity of IoT (Internet of Things), it becomes more common that you need to communicate with hardware.

If that’s not\nenough, and your build is still failing for some vague reason, you can even\ndebug your build script to find the issue!\n\nGetting started\nWhen setting up your first Cake build, there are 3 files of importance:\n\n * Bootstrapper file: will download Cake.exe and all it’s dependencies using a\n   PowerShell script for Windows (build.ps1\n   [https://github.com/cake-build/cake/blob/develop/build.ps1]) or a bash script\n   for Mac OS X/ Linux (build.sh\n   [https://github.com/cake-build/cake/blob/develop/build.sh]). When Cake is\n   already installed with all it’s dependencies, the Cake.exe can also be called\n   directly.\n * Build steps: This file (by default called “build.cake\n   [https://github.com/cake-build/example/blob/master/build.cake]“) contains all\n   the steps that need to be executed for the build to succeed. The build script\n   can be written in a C# Domain-specific language. Because it’s written in C#,\n   you are able to use all the C# features in your script!\n   The execution order of the steps can be manipulated by making steps depend on\n   each other, or by setting criteria. This can be achieved by using extensions\n   methods.\n * NuGet packages: All the dependency required for the build to run are defined\n   in a packages config file (tools/packages.config\n   [https://github.com/cake-build/example/blob/master/tools/packages.config]).\n   The listed dependencies will be installed in the tools folder. An example\n   dependency might for example be a unit test runner.\n\nAfter specifying your build steps and dependencies, you can kick off the build\nby running the bootstrapper file:\n\nMac & Linux:\n\nsh build.sh\n\nWindows:\n\nPS> .\\build.ps1\n\nDon’t hesitate to give Cake Build a try, you can run it side by side with your\ncurrent build without modifying your project! My working example is also \navailable on GitHub\n[https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/tree/master/ToDo/build].\n\nCake.Recipe\nTo ease the re-use of build scripts, Cake.Recipe was introduced. Cake.Recipe is\na set of build tasks which can be consumed through NuGet. For more info, please\nvisit their website [https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Recipe/].\n\nRelated links:\n\n * GitHub – Cake Xamarin example: \n   https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/tree/master/ToDo/build\n * Cake Build: https://cakebuild.net/\n * Gone Mobile Podcast – Cake: http://www.gonemobile.io/58\n * MSDev Podcast – Cake build: \n   http://msdevshow.com/2016/04/cakebuild-with-mattias-karlsson-and-gary-ewan-park/\n * Cake – GitHub: https://github.com/cake-build/cake\n * Motz Codes Live: Continuous Integration for Libraries: \n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0gWjHhJ3IU\n * Laurent Kempé – Moving to Cake: \n   http://laurentkempe.com/2016/04/05/Moving-to-Cake-CSharp-Make/","feature_image":"/content/images/2019/04/cake-build.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Setting up Xamarin build with Cake","meta_description":"There are a lot of different ways for setting up your continuous delivery pipeline these days.

First, you need to add the SkiaSharp.Views.Forms NuGet package\n    [https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms]  to your\n    Xamarin.Forms PCL (or .netstandard) project and platform specific projects.\n    This package depends on the SkiaSharp package\n    [https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp/#], and therefor this NuGet\n    package will be added as well.\n 2. After adding the package, you are able to use the SkiaSharp Views in your\n    Xaml or in your code. If you want to use SkiaSharp in your Xaml, you first\n    need to define the namespace:xmlns:skia=\n    \"clr-namespace:SkiaSharp.Views.Forms;assembly:SkiaSharp.Views.Forms\"To use\n    the Views in your code you only need to add the same namespace as a using.\n 3. The Views.Forms namespace contains a View called SKCanvasView. As the name\n    suggests, this View will create a canvas to draw on. It’s not possible to\n    draw directly onto the SKCanvasView, but the view exposes an EventHandler\n    called PaintSurface\n    [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/event/SkiaSharp.Views.Mac.SKCanvasView.PaintSurface/]\n    . This handler is called when the canvas needs to be (completely) re-drawn\n    and contains an (very important!) argument of type SKPaintSurfaceEventArgs\n    [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.SKPaintSurfaceEventArgs/]\n    . Typically the event will be raised during initialisation or on rotation.\n    It’s also possible to trigger the event manually by calling the \n    InvalidateSurface()\n    [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.SKCanvasView.InvalidateSurface()/] \n     on the SKCanvasView. Registering your event handler can be done in code or\n    in Xaml. In Xaml this can be achieved with the following code:\n    <skia:SKCanvasView PaintSurface=\"Handle_PaintSurface\"/>With this Xaml you\n    tell the SKCanvasView to call the Handle_PaintSurface in your code-behind\n    when the canvas needs to be (re-)drawn. The argument contains a property \n    Surface\n    [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/property/SkiaSharp.Views.Forms.SKPaintSurfaceEventArgs.Surface/] \n     which on his turn contains a property called Canvas\n    [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/property/SkiaSharp.SKSurface.Canvas/]. On\n    this Canvas object we can start drawing!\n 4. The basics of drawing are pretty simple. You need to specify the coordinates\n    of the object you want to draw and you need to pass an instance of type\n    SKPaint. The SKPaint object defines how your object will look. There are 3\n    types of styles\n    [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/SkiaSharp.SKPaintStyle/]:\n\n * Fill: Specify on how to fill an object like for example a circle.\n * Stroke: Specify on how thick and what color the drawing of lines will be.\n * StrokeAndFill: Specifies the styling of the lines drawn and how to fill that\n   object.\n\n5.\tA few examples of drawing a simple shape:\n\nSKPaint blueFill = new SKPaint { Style = SKPaintStyle.Fill, Color = SKColors.Blue };\nSKPaint blackLine = new SKPaint { Style = SkiaSharp.SKPaintStyle.Stroke, StrokeWidth = 10, Color = SKColors.Black };\n \n// Draws a line from 0,0 to 100,100\ncanvas.DrawLine(0, 0, 100, 100, blackLine);\n \n// Draws a rectangle left=0, top=0, right=300, bottom=150\ncanvas.DrawRect(new SKRect(0, 0, 300, 150), blueFill);\n \n// Draws a circle at 100,100 with a radius of 30\ncanvas.DrawCircle(100, 100, 30, blackLine);\n\nBeyond the basics\n\nSkiaSharp has a lot more to offer, but that’s way to much to cover in one\nblogpost. If you want to take it a step further, the following topics might be\ninteresting:\n\n * Bitmaps\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/basics/bitmaps/] \n    allow you to use images in your Canvas.\n * With Transformations\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/transforms/] \n    you can modify the coordinates or size of your objects. This is often used\n   in combination with animations. At this moment you can use the following\n   transformations: Translate\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/SkiaSharp.SKCanvas.Translate/p/SkiaSharp.SKPoint/]\n   , Scale\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/transforms/scale/]\n   , Rotate\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/transforms/rotate/] \n    and Skew\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/transforms/skew/]\n   .\n * Save() [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/SkiaSharp.SKCanvas.Save()/] \n   allows you to save the current state of the canvas. With Restore()\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/SkiaSharp.SKCanvas.Restore/]  you\n   can return to the last saved state. This is very useful when you’ve applied\n   Transforms on your Canvas and you want to go back to the previous state.\n * Animations\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/basics/animation/] \n    can be created by calling InvalidateSurface(). This will trigger the\n   PaintSurface event that you can use to apply your changes to the canvas.\n * In a lot of cases you might want to write something on your Canvas and\n   therefor DrawText()\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/basics/text/] \n    was created. Skia allows you to draw text with a lot of styling options.\n * If you want to draw a line from point to point (and so on), SKPath\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/paths/] \n    might fulfill your needs. Paths can be customised (visually) pretty easy.\n   You can also create curves\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/curves/] \n    to smoothen your path.\n * Creating a gradient can be easily achieved with the SkShader\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/SkiaSharp.SKShader/]  class. You can\n   combine this with some Noise\n   [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/SkiaSharp.SKShader/]  to create a\n   nice texture.\n\nConclusion\nDrawing with SkiaSharp is pretty easy and fun, especially when using the Xamarin\nLive Player. The Live Player allows you to edit your code and instantaneously\nsee your changes. This improves the speed of coding a lot!\n\nSkiaSharp is available for a wide range of platforms, which makes it very\npowerful. Although you can share a lot of code, you always have to keep in mind\nwhat devices sizes and device forms you are developing for.\n\nThe documentation on the Xamarin website\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/skiasharp/]  is\ngreat and they also have a lot of samples. I’ve created a sample project\n[https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/tree/master/SkiaSample]  myself which\ncontains the basics of drawing with SkiaSharp. The result is shown on this image\n(only tested on iPhone 8 and Nexus 5). You can find the code on GitHub\n[https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/tree/master/SkiaSample].

Handwritten text are still in preview.\n\nIf you want to test if Computer Vision suits your needs, you can give it a try\non the website\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/] \n without having to code a single line. This demo will only work for basic\nscenarios (upload an image), if you want to use the more advanced features (like\nreal-time video), I’d suggest you try the API directly.\n\nGetting started\n\nUsing Cognitive Services is pretty straightforward because all of the magic is\navailable through REST API’s. For this post I will focus on the Computer Vision\nAPI, but the other APIs work in a similar way. You can use the API’s with the\nfollowing steps:\n\n 1. To start using Cognitive Services you can create a trial account on the\n    website [https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services]. Click the “Try\n    Cognitive Services for free” button and then click “Get API Key” for the\n    Computer Vision API. After signing in with your account you will get an API\n    key that allows you to create 5000 transactions, limited to 20 per minute. \n    Note: the trial is limited to the westcentralus API (\n    https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0).\n    If you want to implement Cognitive Service in your production environment,\n    you can obtain an API key from the Azure Portal. Therefor you need to create\n    an Cognitive Services resource of the type you want to use (for example:\n    Computer Vision API). When the resource is created, you can get your keys\n    from the Quick Start -> Keys.\n 2. Because Computer Vision is exposed as an REST API, you can call it from your\n    app using HttpClient. Instead of creating your HttpClient, you can also use\n    the NuGet package\n    [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Vision/]  to make\n    your calls to the Computer Vision API.\n    Note: In most cases you don’t want to make the calls directly from your app,\n    but call the Cognitive Services from your server. This will prevent users\n    from stealing your API key (and burning your Azure credits) when they\n    decompile your app or intercept your calls.\n 3. After adding the Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Vision to your backend or frontend,\n    you will be able to use Computer Vision with a few lines of code:\n\n// If you're using a trial, make sure to pass the westcentralus api base URL\nvar visionClient = new VisionServiceClient(API_Key, \"https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0\");\nVisualFeature[] features = { VisualFeature.Tags, VisualFeature.Categories, VisualFeature.Description, VisualFeature.ImageType, VisualFeature. };\nvar result = await visionClient.AnalyzeImageAsync(stream, features.ToList(), null);\n\nFirst we create an VisionServiceClient object with an API key and a base URL.\nTrial keys only work with the WestCentralUS instance and therefor I’m also\npassing the BaseUrl. When you’ve created a client, you can call\nAnalyzeImageAsync. This function takes in a Stream (which contains the image)\nand a list of VisualFeatures. The VisualFeatures specify what you want Computer\nVision to analyse. If you prefer to use the HttpClient instead of the NuGet\npackage, I’d recommend the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipeXRXetmFE] \nwhere René Ruppert explains how to use HttpClient to consume Cognitive Services.\n\nResults\n\nUnfortunately my drawing skills are not good enough for Computer Vision to\nrecognise (with great certainty) what I was drawing. Although it was not sure\nwhat I was drawing, it suggested “Outdoor house” with a accuracy of 0.1875. An\nother tag Computer Vision suggested was “Clock” and I think that’s because the\nsun looks like a clock.\n\nIf you want to give your drawing skills a shot, the code of my experiment is on \nGitHub [https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/tree/master/DrawIt]. For the\ndrawing part of the application I’ve used some code snippets from the \nXamarin.Forms samples\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/xamarin-forms/Effects/TouchTrackingEffectDemos/]\n. Besides this sample app, Xamarin has a lot of great sample apps on their\nGitHub [https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples].\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Computer Vision API or Cognitive Service,\nmake sure to check out the related links below.

A breach in your security can not only cost a lot of money\nbut also the trust of your users. In this article I will briefly cover secure\nnetwork communication, but mostly focus on taking security to the next level\nwith certificate pinning.\n\nBuilding secure mobile apps is difficult because most of the times your app runs\nin a untrusted environment. Users are often not aware of security risks\n[https://www.csoonline.com/article/3241727/mobile-security/5-mobile-security-threats-you-should-take-seriously-in-2018.html] \n and therefor you want to protect them if possible. Public WiFi networks are a\ngreat example. If your user is on public WiFi and your app communicates over an\nun-safe connection (HTTP for example), it’s child’s play to intercept the\nnetwork traffic. This traffic may contain passwords or other sensitive\ninformation that you don’t want anyone else to see.\n\nTo prevent this, HTTP Secure (HTTPS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS]) was\nbuilt. By using HTTPS, communication is encrypted with Transport Layer Security\n(TLS), formerly known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). When your app communicates\nover HTTPS, messages can still be intercepted, but will not be readable to the\ninterceptor. Using HTTPS instead of HTTP should be a no brainer, some mobile\noperating systems (like iOS\n[https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/NetworkingOverview/SecureNetworking/SecureNetworking.html]\n) don’t even allow communicating over HTTP anymore.\n\nAlthough HTTPS will improve your security vastly, it’s still not bulletproof. By\ndefault your OS contains a set of trusted root certificates (e.g.: trusted on\niOS 11 [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208125]). If for some reason a\ncompromised certificate is installed on your device or hackers are able to get a\nvalid certificate from a Certificate authority\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority], communication over HTTPS\nis not so safe anymore. Malicious people will then be able to read or even\nmanipulate your network traffic. This can be done with a Man In The Middle\nAttack (MITM) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack], ARP\nspoofing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing]  or DNS spoofing\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing]. Certificate pinning can help you\nprevent these attacks by verifying that the server is responding with the\nexpected certificate.\n\nCertificate pinning\nCertificate pinning can be used to verify the integrity of the system you are\ncommunicating with. The certificate can be verified in a few different ways:\n\n * Certificate pinning: This is the easiest way of pinning. At runtime you will\n   compare the server certificate with an embedded certificate, when it doesn’t\n   match the request will fail. A downside of this method, is when the\n   certificate changes, you also need to update your app.\n * Public key pinning: This way of pinning is a bit more trickier because you\n   might need to take some extra steps (depending on the platform) to extract\n   the public key from your server certificate. When the public key is extracted\n   it will be compared with an embedded key in your app and when it doesn’t\n   match the request will fail. Because the public key is static and won’t\n   change when the certificate is renewed (if requested with same certificate\n   request), you don’t need to update your app on certificate renewal. Although\n   this is convenient, some companies might have policies on key rotation and\n   therefor app updates might still be required once in a while.\n * Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) pinning: will verify the fingerprint of the\n   certificate to match a hash of the SPKI\n   [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469#section-2.4]. The SPKI consist of the\n   algorithm of the public key, along with the public key. This way of pinning\n   is similar to public key pinning, but uses a different payload. Just like\n   public key pinning, your app doesn’t require an update when a certificate is\n   renewed with the same request.\n\nBesides different ways of pinning, you also have to choose the level of\nverification. To choose a level, it’s important to have an understanding on how\ncertificates are signed. Every Operating System has a list of companies that are\nallowed to issue certificates. The companies in this list are called Certificate\nAuthorities and the list itself is often referred to as Trusted Root\nCertification Authorities Certificate Store. \n\nIf you visit a website over HTTPS, your OS or browser will verify if the\ncertificate is signed by a CA that is listed in your Trusted Root CA Store. If\nthe CA is in your store, the public key of the certificate will be used to\nencrypt your communication. If it’s not in the store, the website will be marked\nas “Not Secure”. With this in mind, it’s clear that you don’t want to install a\nmalicious certificate in your local Trusted Root CA store as this will allow\nsomeone to intercept or manipulate your data. With this in mind, choosing a\nlevel of verification will also impact the level of security and the number of\nrequired updates. The levels you need to choose from are:\n\n * Leaf: This is the most secure verification because it will only allow the\n   actual certificate of your server. Other certificates issued by the same\n   (valid) CA will not pass verification. If for some reason your private key\n   get’s compromised, your app will be bricked until you’ve updated the embedded\n   certificate.\n * Intermediate: Intermediate verification will verify that the certificate is\n   issued by a specific CA. This will often be the company where you bought your\n   certificate. With this verification you are still relying on the CA to only\n   issue certificates to trustworthy companies. This level of pinning is\n   commonly used because it is secure enough in most cases and allows you to\n   renew certificates without updating the app. If your CA is compromised you\n   still need to update your app, but this is not very likely to happen (except\n   for Diginotar\n   [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/09/post-mortem-iranian-diginotar-attack]\n   ).\n * Root: This is the least secure verification because when you trust the root,\n   you also trust all it’s child CA’s. This approach is not very often used in\n   app development.\n\nImplementing in Xamarin\nThere are different ways to implement certificate pinning in Xamarin. You can\nchoose for the native approach which will give you fine grained control or you\ncan choose a cross-platform way which is easier to implement, but also has\nlimitations.\n\nYour choice really depends on what HttpClient implementation you are using.

If you want to use the native handlers, you also have to\nimplement certificate pinning in a native fashion.\n\nOption 1: Cross-platform (ServicePointManager)\n\n\nThe ServicePointManager class exposes a ServerCertificateValidationCallback\n[https://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.servercertificatevalidationcallback(v=vs.110).aspx]\nthat will be called every time you make a network request:\n\nServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => \n{ \n    return _allowedPublicKeys.Contains(certificate?.GetPublicKeyString()); \n};\n\nIn this code sample we are checking if the public key of the server is in the\nlist we’ve embedded in our app. If not, the call wil fail, otherwise it will\nproceed as it would without pinning. A code sample on intermediate pinning can\nde found on GitHub\n[https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/blob/master/CertificatePinning/CertificatePinning/Services/CertficateValidation.cs]\n.\n\nAs previously mentioned, this approach doesn’t work is you’re using the native\nHttpClient handlers, but there is a workaround with the NuGet package \nModernHttpClient [https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient]. If you\ninstall this NuGet package and pass the provided handler to your HttpClient, the\nServicePointManager will be triggered while using the native network stack.\nSadly, since Xamarin added support for native handlers, this NuGet package isn’t\nmaintained anymore. More info can be found on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient]\n\nOption 2: Native (Xamarin.Android) – AndroidClientHandler\n\nOn the Android side of things there are a few different ways of implementing\ncertificate pinning.

Unfortunately, at\nthis moment, there is no Xamarin binding available for TrustKit.\n\nA different approach is to override the\nNSUrlSessionHandlerDelegate:DidReceiveChallenge. This method allows you to\nvalidate certificates and kill the request if it doesn’t match. Unfortunately\nthe NsUrlSessionHandler\n[https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/master/src/Foundation/NSUrlSessionHandler.cs] \n from Xamarin uses a private NSUrlSessionHandlerDelegate which makes hard to\noverride the DidReceiveChallenge. It can still be done, but you’ll have to copy\nthe NsUrlSessionHandler code into your project, which is not ideal.

To implement this, you’ll\nneed to create custom renderers.\n\nViews approach:\n\npublic class SafeImage : Image \n{\n   private readonly SafeService _safeService;\n   public SafeImage(SafeService safeService)\n   {\n      _safeService = safeService;\n   }\n  \n   public async Task Load(string url) \n   { \n      var stream = await _safeService.GetStream(url);\n      if (stream != null)\n      { \n         Source = ImageSource.FromStream(() => stream);\n      } \n   } \n}\n\nThe sample above will make sure that the resource is verified before loading it\nin the ImageView. As mentioned, to verify WebViews, you’ll need to create custom\nrenderers:\n\nAndroid custom renderer\n\nTo verify all the calls (also inside the WebView), you need create a custom\nWebViewClient and add this to your WebView Control. The WebViewClient contains a\nmethod for you to override called ShouldInterceptRequest\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/Android.Webkit.WebViewClient.ShouldInterceptRequest/p/Android.Webkit.WebView/System.String/]\n. Inside this method you’ll want to load the content with your own HttpClient\nand then set the loaded content in the Source property of your WebView. A code\nsample can be found on GitHub\n[https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/blob/master/CertificatePinning/CertificatePinning.Android/Renderers/CustomWebViewRenderer.cs]\n.\n\niOS custom renderer\n\nOn iOS a custom implementation of the UIWebViewDelegate\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/MonoTouch.UIKit.UIWebViewDelegate/]  can\nbe used to verify all calls from the WebView. This delegate contains a method\ncalled ShouldStartLoad\n[https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/MonoTouch.UIKit.UIWebViewDelegate.ShouldStartLoad/] \n that can be overridden for custom validation. If this method returns false, the\nrequest will be cancelled. When it returns true, it will continue proceed with\nthe request. A code sample can be found on GitHub\n[https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/blob/master/CertificatePinning/CertificatePinning.iOS/Renderers/CustomWebViewRenderer.cs]\n.\n\nGet the certificate (public key)\nThere are a lot of tools to get retrieve a public key from a website or\ncertificate. I’ve found C# to be the easiest way:\n\nvar cert = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(\"{filepath}.cer\"); \nvar publicKey = cert.GetPublicKeyString();\n\nIf you don’t have the .cer file, you can use Google Chrome to download it from\nyour API / website:\n\n 1. Click the secure  button in your address bar.\n 2. Then click “Certificate”.\n 3. This will now show the applicable certificates for this site. Select your\n    certificate and drag the certificate icon to your file explorer. This will\n    download the certificate.\n\nHow to verify\nA very simple verification can be done during development by altering your\nembedded key, so it becomes invalid. After altering your key, requests should be\ncancelled as expected.\n\nTo really put your pinning to the test in a more practical situation, you can\nuse a proxy tool like Fiddler [https://www.telerik.com/fiddler], Charles\n[https://www.charlesproxy.com/]  or Mitmproxy [https://mitmproxy.org/]. I’ve\nfound Mitmproxy to be the easiest solution. There is a great blogpost on how to\nconfigure Mitmproxy\n[https://medium.com/sean3z/debugging-mobile-apps-with-mitmproxy-4596e56b3da2].\n\nFor a few dollars, you can also buy the Charles iOS app\n[https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/ios/]. This app will work as proxy\nwithout having to install software on your computer.\n\nDespite what tool you are using, if certificate pinning is implemented\ncorrectly, requests will fail when the proxy is intercepting your requests.\n\nIn addition to the above, Kerry W. Lothrop [https://twitter.com/kwlothrop] \ncreated a great serie of blogposts [https://kerry.lothrop.de/wedskaas1/]  on App\nSecurity and recorded a Xamarin Show [https://youtu.be/blTFwasG21U]  with James\nMontemagno.

With Data Services you get a\nbackend that:\n\n * has low latency\n * has high availability\n * is scaleable \n * is secure\n * is maintained (by Microsoft)\n * offers a web interface to manage the data\n\nThis is all achieved by leveraging the power of Azure Cosmos DB\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction]. Cosmos DB\nenables you to scale storage across any number of Azure’s geographic regions.\nYou can store unstructured or semi-structured data. When modelling your data,\nit's recommended to create self-contained entities as JSON documents. More best\npractices on modelling your data can be found on the Microsoft docs website\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/modeling-data]. \n\nData Services SDK\nIn order to consume the data in your application, Microsoft also published a\nSDK.\n[https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-sdk-dotnet/tree/develop/SDK/AppCenterData] \n This SDK allows you to sync your data with a few lines of code. The SDK will\ntake care of authentication, consistency, offline storage & much more. Currently\nthe SDK is available for native Android, native iOS, Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin,iOS\n& Xamarin.Android. \n\nPartitioning\nIn order to get high performance, the data in Cosmos DB is separated into\npartitions. This means, that for every document you want to save, you also need\nto provide a PartitionKey\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#choose-partitionkey]\n. At this moment there are two DefaultPartitions\n[https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-sdk-dotnet/blob/develop/SDK/AppCenterData/Microsoft.AppCenter.Data.Shared/DefaultPartitions.cs]\nyou can use: UserDocuments & AppDocuments. To get a high performing backend,\nchoosing the right partition key is very important. You can find best practices\non this subject on the Microsoft Docs website\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#choose-partitionkey]\n.\n\nAuthentication\nIf you don't enable authentication on your App Center Data Service, it will be \npublicly available. For some data this might be fine, but with privacy in mind,\nit's often a good idea to secure access to your backend. App Center offers\nanother backend service called Auth\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/auth/]  that can be used to setup\nauthentication for your backend. This allows you to create private  documents,\nwhich can only be accessed by the user that created them. Currently, private and\npublic are the only supported accessibility levels, but the App Center team is\nalso looking to implement \"group\" option. This option would allow you to\nconfigure permissions for a group of users, instead of single users.\n\nThe easiest way to enable Auth, is by connecting App Center to Azure AD B2C\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory-b2c/]. Azure AD B2C\nis an identity management system, focused on business-to-consumer (b2c)\napplications. If you prefer to use a different identity management system, you\ncan still use the Auth features, but then you'll need to provide info about the\nuser using the SDK.\n\nBesides protecting your backend, Auth is enabling you to do even more with App\nCenter. A few examples:\n\n * Relate crashes to a user instead of a device.\n * Relate events  to a user instead of a device.\n * Send push notifications to a specific user.\n * and more.. \n\nPricing of Data Services\nThe prices are based on the pricing model from Azure Cosmos DB. You'll pay for\nthe number of Request Units\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/request-units]  (RU) that you\nuse. For example: Reading 1kb from your backend will cost you 1 RU. The costs\nare based on a few things: region, hours and RU's. The best way to get an\nindication for your costs is by using the Microsoft Pricing Calculator\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGetting Started\nSetting up your app with App Center Data is pretty straight forward. You'll only\nneed an App Center account and an Azure subscription with some credits.\n\nConfiguring the backend\n\nIn order to store data with the Data Service, you'll need to connect your App\nCenter app to an Azure Cosmos DB. This can be achieved with the following steps:\n\n 1. Create an app in App Center (with these steps\n    [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps]\n    )\n 2. Navigate to the app in App Center\n 3. Go to Data in the left menu\n 4. Click on \"new database\". In the future, you can also use an existing\n    database if you want, but this is currently not supported.\n 5. Click on \"Add Subscription\"  and select the Azure subscription that you want\n    to use.\n 6. In the next screen you'll need to provide a name for your database and\n    select the region where you want it to be located. \n 7. On the following screen you can choose the required performance. If you're\n    just starting and don't have a clue on what the usage will be, you should\n    choose the \"I'm just getting started option\". This is the cheapest\n    configuration. You can always change this afterwards in the Azure portal.\n 8. On the final screen you'll get a summary of your backend configuration. If\n    everything is good, hit \"Create Database\".\n 9. If creation of the database was initiated successfully, you'll see a message\n    \"Connecting your database. This may take a few moments.\". When it's done,\n    it'll display a message \"Done connecting.\".\n\nNow, your backend is all set up! \n\nSetting up your backend in App CenterData Services in your app\n\nAs mentioned before, Microsoft published a SDK to easily consume/send data\nfrom/to your App Center backend. Integrating this in your app is similar to\nother App Center services, and can be achieved with the following steps (for\nXamarin.Forms):\n\n 1. Add App Center Nuget package\n    [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AppCenter/]  & App Center Data\n    Nuget package [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AppCenter.Data/]  to\n    your Android, Forms and iOS project. \n 2. Add the following code to the OnStart method in your App.cs (in your Forms\n    code project):\n\nAppCenter.Start(\"ios={Your Xamarin iOS App Secret};android={Your Xamarin Android App secret}\", typeof(Data));\n\n\nnote: you can find the secrets in the App Center portal.\n\n3. Now the SDK is ready to send data to your backend. Wait, it's that easy? \nYep!\n\nStoring data in App Center can be done with Unstructured or structured data. The\neasiest way to get started, is to create classes that contain the data that you\nwant to store. If you want to save Todo items for example, you can create the\nfollowing class:\n\npublic class TodoItem\n{\n    public Guid ID => Guid.NewGuid();\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public string Notes { get; set; }\n    public bool Done { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n4. After you specified a model or multiple models for your data. You can Get,\nGet multiple, Create, Update & Delete these items with the SDK from/to your\nbackend. Creating a TodoItem would require the following code:\n\n\nvar item = new TodoItem\n{\n    Name = \"Test\",\n    Notes = \"Test notes\",\n    Done = fale\n};\n\nawait Data.CreateAsync(item.ID.ToString(), item, DefaultPartitions.UserDocuments, new WriteOptions(_cachingTime));\n              \n\n\nSamples for Getting, Updating and deleting, can be found on GitHub\n[https://github.com/basdecort/Xamarin/tree/master/TodoAppCenter].\n\nConclusion\nBuilding a resilient  and secure  backend can definitely be challenging. The\nMBaas offering from Microsoft makes this a lot easier. The mobile SDK will take\ncare of some complex tasks like offline support, authentication and data\nsynchronisation.\n\nBasically if you need a backend to safely store data in the cloud without a lot\nof custom business logic, App Center Data Services can be a great solution.\nBecause this service is based on Azure Cosmos DB, you’ll get great performance\nout-of-the-box. A drawback might be that Cosmos DB is a bit more expensive than\nother storage solutions. In my opinion, it would be great if you can pick from\ndifferent storage options for your Data Service!\n\nWith Auth Service, Microsoft introduces a way to identify your users more\neasily. When the user information is known in App Center, this can be used\nthroughout al their services! Integrating Auth can be done with Azure AD B2C,\nbut Microsoft will also allow you to use your own identity provider. This makes\nit very powerful for (almost) every project!","feature_image":"/content/images/2019/08/art-astronomy-constellation-1252890.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"App Center Data: High-performing backend as a service","meta_description":"Microsoft announced a new service called App Service Data.
